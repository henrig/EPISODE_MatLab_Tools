# EPISODE MatLab Tools

 A jumbles of different MatLab functions made to read and write EPISODE input and output files. There are tools for ASCII files and NetCDF reading. 
 
 Mainly put here to get re-aquainted with Git / GitHub.
 
 Progressive versions will hopefully contain fewer and a bit more generic functions. As of now each version file from EPSIODE output 
 have different structure, and thus different reading / writing tools. As the ASCII output is about to be phased out and not really used 
 anymore most of thes will hopefully be removed in following updates.
